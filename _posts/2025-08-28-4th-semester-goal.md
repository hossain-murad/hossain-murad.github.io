## 4th Semester Plan

In this blog I am planning my goal for 4th semester in Woosong University as an AI & Big Data major student.

In the 4th semester, I will take the following courses:

1. DataVisualization (004)
2. Essential Mathematics for Al (004)
3. Sol-Connections2 (008)
4. GreatMinds (001)
5. StatisticswithSoftwareTools (001)

So the total credits for this semester will be 15.
3 of these courses are Offline, and 2 are Online courses.
